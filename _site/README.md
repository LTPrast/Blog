For this project I showed some big waves. The index page can bring you to all pages. The index page is the only page with a different lay out. On the index page a gif is seen. All the other pages have pictures. All the pages about the waves have the same lay out which is in default.html. However, they all use this as a lay out and then all have a separate html page so they all can have a different picture. The content of the pages is in the _posts folder where all of them have separate markdown file. Bootstrap is used for all pages for the layout. The stylesheet is called style.css in it are different CSS properties and selectors, with also an #id selector and .class selector. The style.css was made in style.scss, where scss nesting, inheritance and variable are used. Also, a mobile responsive @media query is included.
