                            <p>World-famous big-wave reef at Pillar Point for expert big-wave surfers only. Primarily a right, but the lefts have been ridden by a few brave men. An incredibly hollow, jacking take-off in front of a series of house-sized boulders known as “The Boneyard” is followed by a long, huge wall ending in a deep channel. Starts to work at 12 feet (3.6m) and never closes out. One of the biggest, scariest waves in the world.
There have been two reported shark attacks here, both non-fatal. Heavy currents and lethal rocks on the inside if you get sucked in. This wave has already claimed the lives of big-wave surfer Mark Foo and a kayaker.</p>
